**Version 0.1.3**  
- **Implemented Secure ABS Patches for Enhanced Password Protection During Element Inspection**: In this release, we’ve introduced secure patches using Advanced Buffer Security (ABS) to bolster password security when inspecting page elements. This addition ensures that passwords are kept safe from potential vulnerabilities during inspection, adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. By implementing ABS, we’ve significantly strengthened the security framework of the system, minimizing the risk of exposure during sensitive operations.  

- **Refined User Interface with Rounded Edges for Cleaner Aesthetic and Seamless Navigation**: To elevate the user experience, the interface has undergone a visual overhaul with rounded edges, providing a modern and polished look. These subtle design adjustments create a more visually appealing environment, making the application feel sleek and contemporary. The rounded edges contribute to a smoother flow between interface elements, reducing visual clutter and enhancing the overall usability of the platform for a more intuitive navigation experience.  

- **Revamped Button Layout and Features for Key Functions (View, Hide, Edit, Delete)**: A significant update has been made to the button layout and features, with a focus on streamlining essential functions such as view, hide, edit, and delete. The redesigned buttons have been optimized for faster access and more efficient task management. This change not only improves the flow of user interactions but also simplifies complex actions by providing clearly defined, easy-to-use options, ensuring a more effective and seamless workflow.  

- **Introduced Local Search Function for Faster and More Accurate Search Results**: A new local search function has been added to the platform, enhancing the speed and accuracy of search results. The updated search feature is now more responsive, providing faster results even for users who type at a rapid pace. By streamlining the search UI, we've optimized the user experience for individuals seeking quick access to relevant information, eliminating delays and improving overall efficiency. This change ensures that users can find their desired items in record time, even in larger datasets.  

- **Optimized Saved Password Location for Faster Access and Retrieval**: To improve user convenience, we’ve optimized the system’s ability to load saved passwords more quickly, especially when dealing with larger datasets. This update introduces a direct location feature, enabling faster access to stored passwords, reducing waiting times and streamlining workflows. Users will now experience an increase in performance when managing larger collections of saved passwords, ensuring that data retrieval is more efficient than ever before.  

- **Enhanced Internal Pre-Encryption for Cleaner, Safer Password Storage**: A major security enhancement has been made with the introduction of internal pre-encryption. Passwords are now encrypted before they are stored, offering a cleaner and safer storage solution. This process ensures that passwords are never stored in plain text and provides a higher level of security from potential breaches. By pre-encrypting passwords, we offer users an added layer of protection, ensuring that sensitive information remains fully secured even if the system is compromised.
