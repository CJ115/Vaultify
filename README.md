# Vaultify Password Manager (Version 0.1.3)

**Vaultify** is a locally hosted, client-side password management system designed to provide secure, private, and efficient storage for your credentials. With a focus on robust encryption and an intuitive user experience, Vaultify empowers users to manage their passwords securely without relying on third-party cloud services. It ensures complete autonomy over your sensitive data by storing everything directly on your device.

## Features

- **Client-Side Encryption**  
  Vaultify uses strong AES-based encryption for storing passwords. This guarantees that all stored data remains secure and is only accessible by the authorized user. No password is ever stored in plaintext, ensuring confidentiality at all times.

- **Local Storage Security**  
  All credentials are stored directly in the browser's local storage, providing a fully offline, secure environment. This design eliminates the need for cloud-based storage, ensuring that no data is transmitted or stored remotely.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  The application features a clean, minimalistic design that promotes efficient navigation. The interface has been optimized for ease of use, allowing users to quickly add, retrieve, and manage passwords with minimal effort.

- **Enhanced Data Retention**  
  Vaultify ensures that all credentials are persistently stored across sessions. Data retention mechanisms guarantee that your passwords remain intact, even after browser restarts or system shutdowns.

- **Search & Retrieval Functionality**  
  An integrated search feature allows you to quickly find stored credentials based on website URL, username, or any other associated information, ensuring fast and easy access to your data.

- **Offline Accessibility**  
  Vaultify operates fully offline. No internet connection is required to access or manage your stored credentials, ensuring complete privacy and security at all times.

- **Customizable Password Cards**  
  The UI has been enhanced with new customizable password card colors and layout options, allowing users to visually organize and categorize their credentials for easier management.

- **Secure Password Entry and Storage**  
  Password input fields are designed to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected while entered and stored locally.

- **Future-Proof Security**  
  The architecture is designed to be easily extendable, with plans for implementing even stronger encryption methods in future versions, including AES-256 and RSA encryption.

## Installation

To install **Vaultify**, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release file from the **Stable_Release** section on the official repository.

## Security Measures

- **End-to-End Encryption**  
  All passwords are encrypted before they are stored in the browser's local storage. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your local files, they will not be able to view your passwords without the correct decryption key.

- **No External Server Communication**  
  Vaultify operates entirely offline, and no data is transmitted over the internet. This eliminates the risks associated with server-side breaches, ensuring that your credentials are never exposed to external threats.

- **Local Storage Protection**  
  Vaultify leverages local storage security features to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. This further ensures that all stored credentials remain private and secure.

  Optional local file encryption can be enabled for those who want to add an extra layer of protection for their stored data. This feature provides enhanced security, especially for users who require additional data security protocols.
